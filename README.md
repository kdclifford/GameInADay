# Introduction

This is an Unreal Engine project for one of my University Modules. The task was to create the best game we could in one day. So I had never used Unreal Engine before other then following lesson tasks, Its a game in a day it was just a fun concept its not going to be the next Skyrim.

# Gameplay

I basically stole my game Idea from the Whole in a wall TV show. So your goal is to stay on the platform as long as you can while the wall moves towards. There is a gap or whole in the wall you must move towards it as fast as you can before you are launched off the platform. This sounds easy which it was so I added rainning blocks and a gun to launch the Blocks. Plus the walls will speed up, more blocks will spawn and the wall gap will get smaller the longer you stay on the platform.
